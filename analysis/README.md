# Argumentative Language and Quantifiers Production

Modelling of data from an experiment on argumentative use of quantifiers.

- `explorative.ipynb`: organized quite chaotically, contains a lot of functions / analyses on initial pilot data, as well as visualizations of argstrengths and other various. It also contains more models than we ended up selecting for the full experiment.
- `functions` contains functions used in the notebooks.
- `analysis_fixedarray.ipynb`: analysis of pilot and experiment 1 (production experiment with fixed # students / # questions).
- `analysis_variablearray.ipynb`: analysis of experiment 2 (production experiment with variable # students / # questions).
